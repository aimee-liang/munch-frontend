Have you ever gone back and forth on where to eat with your friends or significant other? Same here. 

Introducing Munch, a breakthrough app. Munch was created using the Zomato API. Each Munchie (user) will have a list of favorite restaurants and reviews on their profile page, which will make your next dining experience that much more fun. When you don't know what you want to eat, you can check out their favorite go-to-spots.

### Logging In/ Signing up

Upon logging in or signing up for the first time, users can see a generic list of restaurants.

<br />
From a select list of neighborhoods, users can enter a type of cuisine they'd like. munch will filter for restaurants that best match their preference based on neighborhood. From there, users can make a reservation.

When a user goes to view their profile, their reservation will be listed. They can cancel there directly.

### Stretch Features
Our stretch goals include a Google Maps API, having users be able to interact with other users by making reservations on each other's profile pages, and providing more detailed information for each restaurant.
